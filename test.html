                        <p>So, what exactly are we trying to establish here? Well, let's say that turning every unturned
                            stone in online publishing is a starting point. We reason that, since we are online (and
                            online only), we neither have to nor want to limit ourselves to run-of-the-mill
                            operations.</p>

                        <p>In 2012, the internet is on your screen, in your pocket and most everywhere else you look.
                            Why shouldn't the advantages it brings have an impact on the media that you read?</p>

                        <p>Can you recall the early days of the web? That was a time when magazines that were bold
                            enough to go online usually didn't bother to do much more than post their offline content on
                            a homepage.</p>

                    <p>We thought we'd elaborate on that concept, and make something a little more future-oriented. Suit
                        Up or Die is the (very polygamous) marriage between a communication philosophy and practice, a
                        visual impression and an outstanding technical platform. All still very influenced by our pithy
                        credo low-key classy. Questions?</p>

                    <p>As you scroll down you will see how we envision the future. It's part new and part old, it
                        doesn't jump out at you, but it doesn't pass like a ship in the night either. It's brand new,
                        but it still recognizable enough to be relevant.</p>

                    <p>That's where we stand now. By necessity, we've taken an experimental approach to it. So
                        essentially, this is us trying out new things. We're doing it for your benefit as much as our
                        own, because we realize that you are as important as oxygen to us. Your support is our air

                    <p>A change is coming. Online publishing has so much more potential, and this is proof of that.</p>

                    novel, it would have been entitled “Artist, Architect, Photographer, Father.” Sergei would have
                    played all four roles. As we reveal here, he is somewhat reluctant to accept one of these labels,
                    but warmly embraces the other three.</em></p>


                <div class="col floatleft">
                    <p>A child of the 1950s Ukraine, <a href="http://www.sviatchenko.dk" target="_blank"><strong>Sergei
                        Sviatchenko</strong></a> came to Denmark at the beginning of the nineties. Three years ago he
                        started taking avant-garde pictures for an art project, and posted the pictures online. His <a
                                href="http://www.closeupandprivate.com" target="_blank"><strong>Close Up and Private
                            (CUAP)</strong></a> project has since been the subject of massive attention, especially from
                        a fashion interested online community, and who is not online these days?</p>

                    <p>Sergei Sviatchenko is the talk of the town because of his innovative way of forging a bond
                        between the worlds of collage art, fashion photography and online exposure. Suit Up or Die met
                        him in Copenhagen to discuss that and other facets of life.</p>

                    <p><strong>What inspired you to create CUAP in the first place?</strong><br/>
                        "Well, I like clothes, and I’ve liked fashion all my life. Maybe it was the idea of reflecting
                        my personal interpretation of style, of clothes that I’ve worn for a long time. Another factor
                        is that I’ve worked with collages for a long time, and I’m well established as a collage artist.
                        I participate in different international exhibits."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col floatright">

                    <p>"The special technique that I use when doing paper collage work, I thought, would be interesting
                        to apply to clothes instead. I want to convey exactly the same feeling, but use clothes instead
                        of paper and scissors. I am lucky to have my son, Erik, to work with."</p>

                    <p>Sergei is proud of his family and talks enthusiastically about his three children, describing
                        himself as much a friend as a father to them. All three have been photographed for CUAP, but
                        Erik, the promising 19-year-old footballer from FC Midtjylland, is the model for 99 percent of
                        the CUAP material.</p>

                    <p>"Still, Erik doesn’t necessarily have the CUAP style; he’s only 19. But if he trusts me, if I put
                        my stuff on him and put it on the internet, it seems to work."</p>

                    <p><strong>There must be a certain dynamic to working with your son. Is it easier to work with him
                        than a model that you come across on the streets of your home town or hire from an
                        agency?</strong>

                <p>"Well, first of all CUAP is a private project, so it is natural that I work with someone close to me,
                    like a family member. It is also very important when I photograph people that I have a lot of
                    sympathy for them. When I started CUAP I decided that it would be based completely on dogma
                    principles. I take the pictures with a compact Leica, with no extra lighting, against a white wall.
                    Nothing more. Those are the principles that I want to work under."</p>

                <p><strong>You never use a larger camera?</strong><br/>
                    "No, never. I’m not a photographer. I am an artist. It’s easier for me to take pictures with a small
                    camera."</p>

            <div class="col floatleft">

                <p><strong>So CUAP is more of an art project than a fashion project?</strong><br/>
                    "It’s an art project, yes, which I swung in the direction of fashion."</p>

                <p><strong>Then you wouldn’t call yourself a fashion photographer?</strong><br/>
                    "No, not at all. I’m glad that all the blogs and magazines that mention me understand that. They
                    call me architect and artist Sergei Sviatchenko, who runs the CUAP project, and I’m happy with
                    that."</p>

                <p>Still, it is interesting to think about what Sergei Sviatchenko is doing when he combines his
                    interest in fashion with his artistry and runs it through a relatively new channel, the blog world.
                    Although he y not be the conventional fashion photographer, his experimental approach has without
                    doubt challenged the world of fashion photography.</p>

                <p><strong>Are there any plans on going deeper into fashion itself? Do you feel that there always has to
                    be an element of art?</strong><br/>
                    "Well, right now I’m creating a new series of collages, which are pure art, but with fashion
                    elements that I’ve shifted over. The idea is that I, inspired by my collage work, start with a pure
                    photography and treat it in a collage way."
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col floatleft">

                <p>"That means that I cut it and transfer it to pure collage, but retain elements of clothes and fashion
                    and style. I’m very excited about this new series, which I call Less Close Up and Private. I’m ready
                    to show that to the world now."</p>


                <p>Danish men’s magazine Euroman named Sergei Sviatchenko the best dressed man in Denmark in 2010 and
                    then recruited him as a style blogger.</p>

                <p><strong>How did they get to know about you?</strong><br/>
                    "Well, I live in town of 60 000 people, and I dress in my own style every day. It’s part of my
                    identity. In Copenhagen people sometimes stop me to take pictures, and in that context Euroman
                    noticed me at a fair. As I am interested in fashion, I have a lot of friends in the business,
                    directors of stores and so on, so I am visible. I am also a buyer. Those factors probably increased
                    my chances of being spotted, but I would say that it was above all a coincidence."</p>

                <p>On the CUAP website, Sergei Sviatchenko has posted a list of statements about fashion, a kind of
                    non-compelling manifesto, which he calls “Etiquette for the Modern Classicist.” It deals with what
                    he perceives to be the fundamentals of classy dressing.

                <p>

            </div>


            <div class="col floatright">
                <p>Many of the style cues on the list have a certain air of timelessness about them, and some would be
                    recognized as very of-the-moment in men’s fashion. Sergei lists brogues, oxford shirts, khakis and a
                    solid vintage watch as classics that men ought to revisit.

                <p>

                <p><strong>The clothing style that is reflected on CUAP is sweeping the fashion world right now, but
                    that is nothing more than a fortunate coincidence for you, is it? You would have come up and out
                    with CUAP regardless of any trends?</strong><br/>
                    "Absolutely. Had I started ten years prior, the effect and response probably wouldn’t have been the
                    same as it has been now though."</p>

                <p><strong>Your style, is it preppy or is it classic?</strong><br/>
                    "I don’t call it preppy. Some blogs call it preppy, but it’s not, absolutely not. I just happen to
                    like some of those items. I like the Ivy heritage very much. The whole American history in the
                    twentieth century, jazz music and everything, all the movements from the fifties and sixties. Most
                    of my inspiration is British though: The Beatles. Also the London dandy, of course."</p>

                    songwriting?</strong><br/>
                    "Actually, I’d say my favorite is Paul McCartney. Look at how creative he is. It’s possible to say

                    "It's hard to beat the sixties. They were the most creative and amazing time in history in my
                    opinion, with
                    people like Jackie Kennedy around. I have a lot of books that cover that era."</p>

                <p><strong>Your grew up in the Ukraine during Soviet rule. How did you get access to the material that
                    inspired you?</strong><br/>
                    "I grew up in a very unique family. My father was a reputable Russian architect and his connections
                    brought home many interesting magazines from England and America."</p>

                <p><strong>Did growing up there affect your career choices? Were there things that you weren’t allowed
                    to do, in art for example?</strong><br/>
                    "I have an architect’s education, which my father inspired me to pursue. I worked as an architect
                    for a while after graduation. People around me, although not in the business of fashion, loved
                    style. There was a bunch of us who, through the music, the LPs, shared an idea of style. Even under
                    the regime it was possible to find the LPs that we listened to. From around 1965 we got more and
                    more involved. By the seventies I was a collector with a vast collection of records issued in
                    Germany and England."</p>

            <div class="col floatright">

                <p><strong>Do you still listen to vinyl?</strong><br/>
                    "Oh, yes. I have a beautiful record player from 1966. When I put my copy of Revolver by The Beatles,
                    from the same year, on the turntable the sound is very authentic."</p>

                <p>In August of 2011, Gant Rugger Denmark issued a lookbook exclusively featuring CUAP-style pictures by
                    Sergei Sviatchenko of his son wearing clothes from the A/W Rugger collection. The lookbook became an
                    internet smash hit, and bloggers have spread the pictures beyond the capacity of any ‘old media,’
                    campaign. The Rugger store in Copenhagen sold out its Hopsack blazer within days of the release of
                    the lookbook.</p>

                <p><strong>Did Rugger approach you or did you approach them?</strong><br/>
                    "They approached me. I had done a Euroman project, through which I was introduced to the Rugger
                    people. The project was about shooting a few items for a normal A/W collection, but with a variety
                    of brands. I chose the clothes myself. I always do, I have a good idea about what I want. So I
                    chose, they packed and sent me the clothes, and I took the pictures. In that shoot I used a lot of
                    Rugger, so they contacted me."</p>

                    collaboration with you is a good marketing idea. Any more plans for collaborations?</strong><br/>
                    "On a typical day I get between five to ten emails asking for collaborations. I have to turn most of
                    them down unfortunately, because CUAP represents a particular style, a particular art project, and I
                    have to be very careful in choosing who to collaborate with."</p>

                <p><strong>When you work with a brand on a project, how does that affect your artistic freedom?</strong><br/>
                    "Well, naturally I demand a lot of freedom to elaborate my ideas."</p>

                    "Well, let’s see how things develop. Merging business with art can be a bit tricky, but there are

                <p><strong>On the subject of fashion photography, how do you feel about a guy like Scott Schuman (the

                <p><strong>Does that happen to CUAP too?</strong><br/>
                    "It does. I’ve realized that there are blogs that copy CUAP straight up and down. Exactly the same:
                    the hand in front of the face for example. I feel OK about it, but when you see something that’s
                    exactly, 100 percent the same, you ask yourself what the point of that is."</p>

                <p>Sergei himself blogs in multiple places. In addition to his own CUAP and <a

                <p><strong>What do you yourself enjoy reading in men’s fashion magazines?</strong><br/>
                    "Interesting things beyond the conventional reading. Where bow ties come from, the history of a
                    jacket. Interesting history, explanations to why things are as they are. One example that I find
                    interesting is that regimental ties have the stripes coming from one side if they’re original
                    British army ties, and the other if they’re from an American manufacturer, like Brooks Brothers.
                    That’s an interesting detail, I think.
                    I’d also like to see some original visual stuff, very dynamic and informative. Illustrations and the
                    like. Also, I’d like to see interesting interviews with respected people from the cinema industry,
                    the art industry, the world of culture. Their points of view would be very interesting to me."

            <div class="col floatright">
                <p>No doubt Sergei Sviatchenko is a multifaceted man. By combining his profession with one of his
                    greatest interests, he has opened the door to something quite groundbreaking. It is hard to see that
                    a completely non-commercial path is feasible for most artists. At the same time, artistic integrity
                    will inevitably nosedive if commercial aspects are too closely heeded. Sergei has arguably been very
                    careful to balance the two. What the future holds in store for the international artist is hard to
                    gauge, but do not bet against it being more unique collaborations in the field of collage art and
                    fashion. Or something completely different from a man with ideas and a popular platform.</p>

            Twice." Serenaded by both Frank Sinatra and Ryan Adams. The Greatest City in the World according to

        <div class="clearfix threecol">

            <div class="col floatleft">

                <p>New York is quite possibly the most versatile city on the planet. That's not a very original
                    statement, but we still can't help thinking that NY is one of our favorite places.</p>

                <p>That doesn't mean that we don't like other cities or that we want to spend our whole lives in its
                    urban jungles.</p>

                <p>No, there are plenty of ideals that New York will never live up to. Cleanliness, politeness and
                    humility are a few of those.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="col floatleft">

                <p>It is still more intriguing than any other city. It might be the atmosphere of continuous action, it
                    might its vastness. It might even be the smell of the Hudson River that makes New York so
                    intriguing.</p>

                <p>Some argue that it is the center of Western civilization, others say that it is the cradle of Western
                    decadence. Both are right. New York is at the heart of almost everything Americo-centric. The arts,
                    the literature, the music, the fashion scenes.</p>

                <p>All of those things, and a few others, make it completely depraved and dangerously alluring.</p>

                            back. We’re grateful you made it here. And let’s not forget that we are all indebted to Tim
                            Berners-Lee (the ‘creator’ of the internet), Mark Zuckerberg and all those other techies.
                            And also to a Danish artist.</p>

                        <p> It was the explosion of image blogging on Tumblr that kicked it all off. I started following
                            dozens of Tumblr blogs. Inspiration, interiors, fashion, food: everything I came across.
                            Twenty or thirty image blogs every day. I saved pics I liked in a folder. It grew into two
                            folders, four, then six. As my collection grew, so did my addiction.</p>

                        <p><strong>Today, I thank Tumblr for that.</strong></p>

                        <p>One day I decided to do something creative with my all the images I had saved. That was how
                            my own blog came to be. I selected the pics and the order in which they appeared. I focused
                            on things I loved: creativity, inspiration and fashion.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="col floatright">

                        <p>After a day or two of hesitation, I linked to the blog on Facebook. The link went viral. My
                            worries about not being understood disappeared. The hit count and reviews made my day.</p>

                        <p><strong>Thank you Facebook.</strong></p>

                        <p class="marginbottom150">While I was working on my blog, I came across a true inspirer, a man
                            named Sergei Sviatchenko. He is an international artist, big in fashion photography.</p>

                        <p>We had similar ideas. His pictures were eye-catching, original and captivating. Art, fashion
                            and technology in one. He'd created something unique.</p>


                    </div>

                </div>

                <div class="col floatright">

                    <p>I <span class="strike">nicked</span> borrowed a couple of images from Sergei. Probably shouldn’t
                        have, but I had to spread his work. My admiration at least afforded him a link.</p>

                    <p>When my blog reached almost 50 000 hits and around 500 Facebook likes, I decided to get more out
                        of it. With a couple of partners, I developed a webmag. We just wanted to try something new,
                        break a few rules, push the limits, cause a stir.</p>

                    <p>Then there was the link to Sergei Sviatchenko’s site. Turns out he got a lot of hits from it. So
                        many that he had to check out where they came from. Soon after, Sergei sent us a humble mail
                        about the newest additions to his online gallery. We responded, and then went to Copenhagen to
                        interview the possibly most interesting crossover artist of our times. Seize the moment, eh?</p>

                    <p>Who knows what the future holds? This whole internet business is super dynamic and we love it.
                        The opportunities it provides are infinite. I just hope that when I'm 58, I use the internet in
                        the creative and original way Sergei does.</p>

                <div class="col floatleft">
                    <p>Portraying both lighthearted idealism (The Ugly American) and the most sinister depths of human
                        nature (Apocalypse Now), Marlon Brando's always made the people he played convincing and
                        spellbinding. He gave them life.</p>

                    <p>But Brando was much more than just an accomplished actor. Off-screen he was just as strong a
                        character and enigma. The 1973 Oscars, where he was nominated for Best Actor, he boycotted,
                        sending Native American Indian Sacheen Littlefeather in his place.</p>

                    <p>His objective? To draw attention to the treatment of the Native American population. Brando, of
                        course, clinched the Oscar for his role in the Godfather, and Littlefeather's acceptance speech
                        on his behalf is a talking point even today.</p>

                    <p>The couple's dedication to following their creative urges led to a series of inspired and
                        inspiring furniture designs.</p>

                    <p>One of those is the Dining Side chair Wood-base (DSW for short), crafted from molded plastics and
                        wood from the walnut tree. A simple yet elegant Eames classic. It was first shown to the public
                        at a low-cost furniture design competition at New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 1948.</p>

                    <p>The design of this particular chair, the easy and soft lines that evoke a sense of finesse, has
                        made it a classic that will endure for decades to come.</p>

                            The Architect & The Painter</em>. Make sure you see it if the DSW whets your fascination for
                        industrial design and the so-called creative process.</p>

                    <p class="sprite">THE NEW McQUEEN</p>

                    <div class="col floatleft">

                        <p>In terms of impact, Bullitt might be Steve McQueen’s finest hour. We remember him grinding
                            down the mafia’s sinister dealings while being hounded by his superiors. And who can forget
                            the 1968 Mustang pursuit that made car chases ubiquitous in police drama?</p>

                        <p>Other things we vividly recall are the navy turtleneck and chukkas McQueen sport for most of
                            the film. Those, plus his hair, his glasses and the best looking jacket a policeman ever
                            wore did their part in building the King of Cool moniker. Bullitt defines Steve McQueen as a
                            style icon and helped shape a sartorial era.</p>

                        <p>It remains to be seen whether Drive has that kind of impact on our times. We have a hunch
                            that it will. Going over the arguments, we find that Ryan Gosling is completely comfortable
                            in the Persols and the slim-cut and waist-long jacket. He drives like a full-blooded
                            professional and gives the slightly tacky habit of rolling a toothpick around in his mouth a
                            well-needed air of cool. Above all, Gosling radiates that easy <em>McQueeness</em>.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="col floatright">

                        <p>As far as image goes, Gosling is edging closer and closer to being the icon in acting today.
                            He is, as they say, the man who the guys want to be and the girls want to be with.</p>

                        <p>On screen, Frank Bullitt and Gosling's nameless character from Drive are polar opposites.
                            Bullitt, the mob-hounding hell-bender, is everything Gosling's young escape wheelman in
                            Drive is not.</p>

                        <p>But in life beyond the silver screen, Ryan Gosling reminds us of Steve McQueen more than
                            anyone else. They both embody modern male style with alarmingly little effort. With the
                            roles Gosling has been cast in over the past year, he may have already mounted a throne
                            that's been vacant for quite some time.</p>

                        <p><strong>Postscript.</strong>We're not gonna dive into any Dalaiistic reincarnation coo-doo
                            here, but just think about this: McQueen passed into eternity on the 7th of November 1980.
                            Ryan Gosling drew his first breath five days later, on the 12th. Coincidence?</p></div>
