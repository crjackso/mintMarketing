                        <p>So, what exactly are we trying to establish here? Well, let's say that turning every unturned
                            stone in online publishing is a starting point. We reason that, since we are online (and
                            online only), we neither have to nor want to limit ourselves to run-of-the-mill
                            operations.</p>

                        <p>In 2012, the internet is on your screen, in your pocket and most everywhere else you look.
                            Why shouldn't the advantages it brings have an impact on the media that you read?</p>

                        <p>Can you recall the early days of the web? That was a time when magazines that were bold
                            enough to go online usually didn't bother to do much more than post their offline content on
                            a homepage.</p>

                        Up or Die is the (very polygamous) marriage between a communication philosophy and practice, a
                        visual impression and an outstanding technical platform. All still very influenced by our pithy

                    <p>As you scroll down you will see how we envision the future. It's part new and part old, it
                        doesn't jump out at you, but it doesn't pass like a ship in the night either. It's brand new,
                        but it still recognizable enough to be relevant.</p>

                    <p>That's where we stand now. By necessity, we've taken an experimental approach to it. So
                        essentially, this is us trying out new things. We're doing it for your benefit as much as our
                        own, because we realize that you are as important as oxygen to us. Your support is our air

        <p><em class="vollkorn fontsize32">Gotham or the Apple, the Big Apple. Or maybe "The City So Nice, They Named It
            Twice." Serenaded by both Frank Sinatra and Ryan Adams. The Greatest City in the World according to
            Letterman announcer Alan Kalter. New York.</em></p>

        <div class="clearfix threecol">

            <div class="col floatleft">

                <p>New York is quite possibly the most versatile city on the planet. That's not a very original
                    statement, but we still can't help thinking that NY is one of our favorite places.</p>

                <p>That doesn't mean that we don't like other cities or that we want to spend our whole lives in its
                    urban jungles.</p>

                <p>No, there are plenty of ideals that New York will never live up to. Cleanliness, politeness and
                    humility are a few of those.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="col floatleft">

                <p>It is still more intriguing than any other city. It might be the atmosphere of continuous action, it
                    might its vastness. It might even be the smell of the Hudson River that makes New York so
                    intriguing.</p>

                <p>Some argue that it is the center of Western civilization, others say that it is the cradle of Western
                    decadence. Both are right. New York is at the heart of almost everything Americo-centric. The arts,
                    the literature, the music, the fashion scenes.</p>

            </div>


            <div class="col floatright">

                <p>All of those things, and a few others, make it completely depraved and dangerously alluring.</p>

                <p>Whatever your feelings, whatever your experiences, you have to agree with this: you can't ignore New
                    York.</p>

                        rich mosaic of inspiration, art and fashion held together by the glue of modern technology.</em>
                    </p>

                    <div class="col floatleft">

                        <p><span class="italic">Suit Up or Die</span> - a webmag. A novelty, and unthinkable a few years
                            back. We’re grateful you made it here. And let’s not forget that we are all indebted to Tim
                            Berners-Lee (the ‘creator’ of the internet), Mark Zuckerberg and all those other techies.
                            And also to a Danish artist.</p>

                        <p> It was the explosion of image blogging on Tumblr that kicked it all off. I started following
                            dozens of Tumblr blogs. Inspiration, interiors, fashion, food: everything I came across.
                            Twenty or thirty image blogs every day. I saved pics I liked in a folder. It grew into two
                            folders, four, then six. As my collection grew, so did my addiction.</p>

                        <p><strong>Today, I thank Tumblr for that.</strong></p>

                        <p>One day I decided to do something creative with my all the images I had saved. That was how
                            my own blog came to be. I selected the pics and the order in which they appeared. I focused
                            on things I loved: creativity, inspiration and fashion.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="col floatright">

                        <p>After a day or two of hesitation, I linked to the blog on Facebook. The link went viral. My
                            worries about not being understood disappeared. The hit count and reviews made my day.</p>

                        <p><strong>Thank you Facebook.</strong></p>

                        <p class="marginbottom150">While I was working on my blog, I came across a true inspirer, a man
                            named Sergei Sviatchenko. He is an international artist, big in fashion photography.</p>

                        <p>We had similar ideas. His pictures were eye-catching, original and captivating. Art, fashion
                            and technology in one. He'd created something unique.</p>


                    </div>

                </div>

                <div class="col floatright">

                    <p>I <span class="strike">nicked</span> borrowed a couple of images from Sergei. Probably shouldn’t
                        have, but I had to spread his work. My admiration at least afforded him a link.</p>

                    <p>When my blog reached almost 50 000 hits and around 500 Facebook likes, I decided to get more out
                        of it. With a couple of partners, I developed a webmag. We just wanted to try something new,
                        break a few rules, push the limits, cause a stir.</p>

                    <p>Then there was the link to Sergei Sviatchenko’s site. Turns out he got a lot of hits from it. So
                        many that he had to check out where they came from. Soon after, Sergei sent us a humble mail
                        about the newest additions to his online gallery. We responded, and then went to Copenhagen to
                        interview the possibly most interesting crossover artist of our times. Seize the moment, eh?</p>

                    <p>Who knows what the future holds? This whole internet business is super dynamic and we love it.
                        The opportunities it provides are infinite. I just hope that when I'm 58, I use the internet in
                        the creative and original way Sergei does.</p>

                    <div class="quotebox">

                    </div>


                    <p>So far, this whole blogging and webmag business has been a ride, and I it is still in its
                        infancy. All thanks to a little creativity, a little inspiration, an interest in fashion and an
                        internet connection.</p>

                    <p>Whenever Brando stepped in front of a camera, it seems he could turn into just about anybody.
                        From the leader of the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, through Zapata and Mark Anthony, he embodied
                        the Godfather (to the right) as well as the eerie Colonel Kurtz.</p>

                    <p>Method acting was Brando's passion, and something he took seriously. Rumors say he studied his

                        health or that of his loved ones. Small price to pay if you want to live forever.</p>

                    <p>Portraying both lighthearted idealism (The Ugly American) and the most sinister depths of human
                        nature (Apocalypse Now), Marlon Brando's always made the people he played convincing and
                        spellbinding. He gave them life.</p>

                    <p>But Brando was much more than just an accomplished actor. Off-screen he was just as strong a
                        character and enigma. The 1973 Oscars, where he was nominated for Best Actor, he boycotted,
                        sending Native American Indian Sacheen Littlefeather in his place.</p>

                    <p>His objective? To draw attention to the treatment of the Native American population. Brando, of
                        course, clinched the Oscar for his role in the Godfather, and Littlefeather's acceptance speech
                        on his behalf is a talking point even today.</p>

                    <p>The couple's dedication to following their creative urges led to a series of inspired and
                        inspiring furniture designs.</p>

                    <p>One of those is the Dining Side chair Wood-base (DSW for short), crafted from molded plastics and
                        wood from the walnut tree. A simple yet elegant Eames classic. It was first shown to the public
                        at a low-cost furniture design competition at New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 1948.</p>

                    <p>The design of this particular chair, the easy and soft lines that evoke a sense of finesse, has
                        made it a classic that will endure for decades to come.</p>

                            The Architect & The Painter</em>. Make sure you see it if the DSW whets your fascination for
                        industrial design and the so-called creative process.</p>

                    <p class="sprite">THE NEW McQUEEN</p>

                    <div class="col floatleft">

                        <p>In terms of impact, Bullitt might be Steve McQueen’s finest hour. We remember him grinding
                            down the mafia’s sinister dealings while being hounded by his superiors. And who can forget
                            the 1968 Mustang pursuit that made car chases ubiquitous in police drama?</p>

                        <p>Other things we vividly recall are the navy turtleneck and chukkas McQueen sport for most of
                            the film. Those, plus his hair, his glasses and the best looking jacket a policeman ever
                            wore did their part in building the King of Cool moniker. Bullitt defines Steve McQueen as a
                            style icon and helped shape a sartorial era.</p>

                        <p>It remains to be seen whether Drive has that kind of impact on our times. We have a hunch
                            that it will. Going over the arguments, we find that Ryan Gosling is completely comfortable
                            in the Persols and the slim-cut and waist-long jacket. He drives like a full-blooded
                            professional and gives the slightly tacky habit of rolling a toothpick around in his mouth a
                            well-needed air of cool. Above all, Gosling radiates that easy <em>McQueeness</em>.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="col floatright">

                        <p>As far as image goes, Gosling is edging closer and closer to being the icon in acting today.
                            He is, as they say, the man who the guys want to be and the girls want to be with.</p>

                        <p>On screen, Frank Bullitt and Gosling's nameless character from Drive are polar opposites.
                            Bullitt, the mob-hounding hell-bender, is everything Gosling's young escape wheelman in
                            Drive is not.</p>

                        <p>But in life beyond the silver screen, Ryan Gosling reminds us of Steve McQueen more than
                            anyone else. They both embody modern male style with alarmingly little effort. With the
                            roles Gosling has been cast in over the past year, he may have already mounted a throne
                            that's been vacant for quite some time.</p>

                        <p><strong>Postscript.</strong>We're not gonna dive into any Dalaiistic reincarnation coo-doo
                            here, but just think about this: McQueen passed into eternity on the 7th of November 1980.
                            Ryan Gosling drew his first breath five days later, on the 12th. Coincidence?</p></div>
